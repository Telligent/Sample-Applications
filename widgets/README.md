#Widgets

Widgets are the primary method of extending the user interface of Telligent Community either by changing how things are presented, adding new elements to pages or exposing new functionality.

This is a collection of widgets created by Telligent, Telligent customers, Telligent Partners and members of the Telligent Developer community.  They are here to be used how you choose, either to enhance your community experience or to serve as examples/guides for widgets you wish to create yourself.


All widgets here are available under the [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license.


These widgets are provided for example and informational purposes only and are not included in normal product support.  However if you find an issue let us know and we will try to get it fixed or contact the developer responsible to assist.  If you want to tackle it yourself, feel free to change it and submit a pull request.
