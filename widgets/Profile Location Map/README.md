# Google Profile Location

###What is the Google Profile Widget?
These widgets are for the Community Server platform and allow you to use Google maps to display a person's location from their profile page.

###Installation:

1.  Go to your Telligent Community website and sign in as a user that has permissions to access the Control Panel.

2.  Go to Control Panel > Site Administration and click on the Widget Studio tab.

3.  Within Widget Studio select the Manage Widgets tab and click the Import Widgets button (on the right-side of the screen).

4.  Browse to the location of the XML file containing the widget(s).

5.  The widgets are installed and available.

###Usage
This widget looks for a user profile field ‘location’. If the ‘location’ profile field is found and contains a value the widget will display a Google maps widget and render a pin on the location value. 

For example, if the user’s location is set to ‘San Francisco’ a map will appear in the user’s profile with a pin on San Francisco.
